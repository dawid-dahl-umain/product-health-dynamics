# Product Health Dynamics

A simulation that predicts how software quality evolves based on **engineering rigor** and **system complexity**. It reveals the hidden cost of "vibe coding" and quantifies the effort required to recover.

> _You've built an app. It works. And one day as you are polishing some styling, the AI accidentally deletes 40% of the tests in the backend part of the app. You do not notice, because you are vibe coding, and in the process of making coffee in another room._
>
> _You happily go about your day, blissfully unaware of all what is going on inside the code realms._
>
> _Fast forward two weeks. You now ask the AI to add a new feature. It does. Worked yet again, "vibe coding is great!"_
>
> _Then suddenly, BOOM!_
>
> _Apparently feature x and y broke, now when feature z was added. If we only had tests that would have prevented this..._
>
> _Now we're in a bad situation. Because when I vibe-asked the AI to fix feature x and y while also keeping feature z working, they all started working... but then feature a, b and c suddenly broke, and feature d breaks also, but not always._
>
> _This is the situation I predict every vibe coded project will eventually end up in, if one keeps doing it._

**The question this model answers:** Why does AI-assisted "vibe coding" work at first, then suddenly fall apart? What does recovery actually cost, in both quality AND time?

## Quick Summary (No Math)

- **Product Health (PH)** measures how easy code is to change (1 = nightmare, 10 = trivial).
- Every code change can help, hurt, or do nothing. The outcome depends on **Engineering Rigor (ER)**: the skill and discipline of whoever makes the change.
- **System Complexity (SC)** determines how forgiving the system is. A blog is forgiving; an enterprise platform is not.
- **High PH protects you.** In a healthy codebase, even low-rigor changes are caught by tests, monitoring, and modular boundaries. Damage is contained.
- **Low PH punishes you.** In a coupled codebase, mistakes cascade. The same change causes 10-100x more damage.
- **Decay accelerates.** A healthy codebase drifts slowly, then suddenly falls apart once safety nets erode.
- **Recovery is slow, then accelerates, then plateaus.** Untangling a mess takes time before progress shows.
- **Degraded systems are slow.** Changes take 2-3x longer due to debugging, coordination, and regression testing. You pay in both quality AND velocity.

### The Two Inputs

The model has two inputs. Everything else is derived.

**Engineering Rigor (ER)** determines three things:

| Property    | Formula                            | Meaning                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Base Impact | `μ = 2.4 × (ER - 0.25 × (1 + SC))` | Expected PH change per commit |
| Base Sigma  | `σ = 0.1 + 0.7 × (1 - ER)`         | Outcome unpredictability      |
| Max Health  | `maxPH = 5 + 5 × ER`               | Sustainable ceiling           |

**System Complexity (SC)** scales the difficulty:

| SC                | Breakeven ER | Meaning                                |
| ----------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 0.25 (blog)       | 0.31         | Even juniors maintain it               |
| 0.50 (CRUD)       | 0.38         | Some discipline required               |
| 1.00 (enterprise) | 0.50         | Only skilled engineers sustain quality |

### Traction and Fragility

The model separates how Product Health affects **improvement** versus **degradation**. This creates emergent S-curve behavior without artificial thresholds.

**Normalized Health** maps PH (1-10) to a 0-1 scale:

```text
normalized = (PH - 1) / 9
```

**Traction** (for improvement) uses a power curve that makes progress slow at low PH and faster at high PH:

```text
traction = normalized^1.5
```

**Fragility** (for degradation) uses an inverse power curve that makes systems stable at high PH and increasingly fragile at low PH:

```text
fragility = (1 - normalized)²
```

System Complexity provides a floor. Simple systems never become as "frozen" as complex ones:

```text
effectiveTraction = (1 - SC) + SC × traction
effectiveFragility = fragility × SC
```

| PH  | Traction | Fragility | Simple (SC=0.25) Traction | Enterprise (SC=1.0) Traction |
| --- | -------- | --------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 8   | 0.68     | 0.05      | 0.92                      | 0.68                         |
| 5   | 0.32     | 0.31      | 0.83                      | 0.32                         |
| 2   | 0.04     | 0.79      | 0.78                      | 0.04                         |

**Plain meaning:** At PH=8, seniors have good traction (0.68) and degradation is contained (fragility 0.05). At PH=2, improvement is nearly impossible (traction 0.04) while damage cascades (fragility 0.79).

### The Compounding Effect

This is the core insight: **damage multiplies in unhealthy systems, and recovery is slow at first.**

When base impact is negative (degradation):

```text
effectiveDamage = baseDamage × fragility
```

- At PH=8: fragility ≈ 0.05, so only ~5% of potential damage applies. Tests catch regressions, modules contain blast radius.
- At PH=2: fragility ≈ 0.79, so ~80% of potential damage applies. Every mistake cascades.

The same low-rigor agent causes **~16x more degradation** in a coupled system than a healthy one.

When base impact is positive (improvement):

```text
effectiveImprovement = baseImprovement × traction × ceilingFactor
```

- At PH=2: traction ≈ 0.04, so only ~4% of improvement effort lands. The system is too tangled to respond.
- At PH=8: traction ≈ 0.68, so ~68% of improvement effort lands. Healthy systems accept changes gracefully.

**The S-curve emerges naturally:** At low PH, traction is near zero, so progress is glacial. As PH improves, traction grows, so progress accelerates. Near the ceiling, diminishing returns slow it again. No artificial sigmoid is needed; the behavior emerges from compounding dynamics.

### Time Cost: The Velocity Penalty

Degraded systems don't just produce worse outcomes; they're slower. The model tracks cumulative time **as a separate output** (not part of the ΔPH equation):

```text
systemState = (1 - SC) + SC × normalized
timeCost = 1.0 + 2.0 × (1 - systemState)
```

| PH (Enterprise) | Tractability | Time Cost | What It Represents  |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------------- |
| 10              | 1.0          | 1.0x      | Baseline speed      |
| 5               | 0.44         | 2.1x      | Twice as slow       |
| 1               | 0.0          | 3.0x      | Three times as slow |

**The double penalty:** A vibe-coded project ends up with unusable code AND takes 2-3x longer to ship the same number of features. This is why "fast and cheap" development is neither.

### Each Change Event

Each change is a probabilistic event. The model draws from a Normal distribution:

```text
ΔPH = μ_eff + complexityDrift + σ_eff × N(0,1) × attenuation
```

| Term            | What It Represents                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| μ_eff           | Expected impact (help or hurt)           |
| complexityDrift | Inherent disorder accumulating over time |
| σ_eff × N(0,1)  | Random component (the dice roll)         |
| attenuation     | How much randomness matters (see below)  |

**Key insight: Degradation and improvement have different variance profiles.**

For **degradation** (negative impact agents):

- Variance has a baseline (0.3) plus scales with fragility
- At high PH: visible bands during the early decline (fragility is low but baseline ensures some spread)
- At low PH: higher variance, but all runs converge to PH=1 anyway

For **improvement** (positive impact agents):

- Variance follows a bell curve, peaking in the transition zone (around PH=5)
- At low PH: lower variance (frozen system, limited outcomes)
- At mid PH: higher variance (chaotic transition zone)
- At high PH: lower variance (stable, predictable improvements)

This creates asymmetric confidence bands:

- Low-ER agents show visible bands during decline, then converge to PH=1
- High-ER agents have wider bands in the transition zone, tighter at extremes
- Ideal agents (ER=1) maintain tight bands everywhere (skill transcends complexity)

## Agent Profiles

| Agent              |  ER | Base Impact (SC=1.0) | Base Impact (SC=0.25) | Max Health |
| ------------------ | --: | :------------------: | :-------------------: | :--------: |
| AI Vibe Coder      | 0.3 |        -0.48         |         -0.03         |    6.5     |
| AI with Guardrails | 0.4 |        -0.24         |         +0.21         |    7.0     |
| Junior Engineer    | 0.5 |         0.00         |         +0.45         |    7.5     |
| Senior Engineer    | 0.8 |        +0.72         |         +1.17         |    9.0     |

**Key insight:** In enterprise systems, juniors break even while vibe coders degrade. In simple systems, vibe coders are nearly breakeven (-0.03) and juniors have solid positive impact. Simple systems forgive; complex systems punish.

## Complexity Profiles

| Profile    | SC   | Example                           | Character                                |
| ---------- | ---- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Simple     | 0.25 | Blog, landing page                | Very forgiving; most agents can maintain |
| Medium     | 0.50 | CRUD backend with auth            | Some discipline required                 |
| Enterprise | 1.00 | Complex domain, many integrations | Only high ER sustains quality            |

## What You'll See

The visualization shows trajectories starting at PH=8, representing the end of the "shape phase" where AI had full context.

**Enterprise (SC=1.0):**

- **AI Vibe:** Plateau at high PH, then accelerating decline, bottoming at PH=1
- **Junior:** Drifts slowly toward PH=3-4
- **Senior:** Climbs toward ~9, slight drift from accumulated complexity
- **Handoff (AI → Senior):** S-curve recovery from PH=1 to ~9

**Simple (SC=0.25):**

- **AI Vibe:** Nearly breakeven; slow drift, stays much healthier
- **Junior:** Positive impact; climbs toward ceiling
- **Handoff:** Rapid recovery from any low point

## For Client Conversations

When a client suggests AI-assisted non-engineers can replace professional engineering:

1. **Present the model.** Engineering Rigor determines all outcomes. Low ER produces negative expected impact per change.

2. **Run the simulation.** Show the trajectory AND the time cost. They pay twice: worse quality AND slower delivery.

3. **Reference theory.** This aligns with [Lehman's Laws](./docs/theoretical-grounding.md): complexity grows unless actively reduced, quality declines unless rigorously maintained.

4. **Quantify the tradeoff.** For 1000 changes in an enterprise system:
   - Senior Engineers: Final PH ~8.7, Time overhead ~1%
   - AI Vibe Coding: Final PH ~1.0, Time overhead ~180%

### Complete Formulas

**Normalized health (0-1 scale):**

```math
n = \frac{PH - 1}{9}
```

**Traction (for improvement, with complexity floor):**

```math
traction_{raw} = n^{1.5}
```

```math
traction = (1 - SC) + SC \times traction_{raw}
```

**Fragility (for degradation):**

```math
fragility = (1 - n)^2 \times SC
```

**Expected impact:**

```math
\mu_{base} = 2.4 \times (ER - 0.25 \times (1 + SC))
```

```math
\mu_{eff} = \begin{cases}
\mu_{base} \times fragility & \text{if } \mu_{base} \leq 0 \\
\mu_{base} \times traction \times \max(0, 1 - (PH/maxPH)^2) & \text{if } \mu_{base} > 0
\end{cases}
```

**Sigma (variance):**

```math
\sigma_{base} = 0.1 + 0.7 \times (1 - ER)
```

For improvement (positive impact):

```math
bellFactor = 4 \times systemState \times (1 - systemState)
```

```math
\sigma_{eff} = \sigma_{base} \times (0.6 + 0.4 \times bellFactor)
```

For degradation (negative impact):

```math
\sigma_{eff} = \sigma_{base} \times 0.6 \times (0.3 + 0.7 \times fragility)
```

**Accumulated complexity:**

```math
systemState = (1 - SC) + SC \times n
```

```math
drift = -(0.005 + 0.00005 \times changeCount) \times systemState \times SC
```

**Variance attenuation (asymmetric for improvement):**

```math
baseAttenuation = 0.15 + 0.85 \times bellFactor
```

```math
effectiveChallenge = (1 - ER) \times SC
```

```math
varianceBoost = systemState \times \max(0, \mu_{base}) \times effectiveChallenge \times 2.5
```

```math
attenuation = baseAttenuation + varianceBoost
```

The variance boost only applies when:

- `μ_base > 0` (agent is improving the system)
- `systemState` is high (agent at healthy PH, where systemState = (1-SC) + SC × n)
- `effectiveChallenge > 0` (agent is non-ideal in a complex system)

**Ceiling resistance (when PH > maxPH):**

```math
resistance = e^{-5 \times \frac{PH - maxPH}{maxPH}}
```

**Time cost (tracked separately, not part of ΔPH):**

```math
timeCost = 1.0 + 2.0 \times (1 - systemState)
```

```math
cumulativeTime = \sum_{i=0}^{n} timeCost_i
```

**Change event:**

```math
\Delta PH = \mu_{eff} + drift + \sigma_{eff} \times N(0,1) \times attenuation \times resistance
```

```math
PH_{n+1} = clamp(PH_n + \Delta PH, 1, 10)
```

### The Complete Equation

```math

### The Story

1. **Skill (μ_eff)** determines whether changes help or hurt on average
2. **Complexity (SC)** sets the difficulty; simple systems forgive, complex systems punish
3. **Time (drift)** works against everyone, but slower for simple systems
4. **Traction** gates improvement; at low PH, even good engineers struggle to land changes
5. **Fragility** amplifies degradation; at low PH, every mistake cascades
6. **The S-curve emerges naturally** from compounding; no artificial thresholds needed
7. **Degradation shows variance** during early decline, then converges to PH=1
8. **Improvement has uncertainty**; even skilled agents face unexpected challenges in complex systems
9. **Time cost** means degraded systems are slow, not just bad
10. **In the long run**, only sustained high-skill effort can outpace complexity
